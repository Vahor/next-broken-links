## About

This is a CLI tool that will check broken links in your Next.js project.\

The experimental nextjs [Statically Typed Links](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/typescript#statically-typed-links) feature is not enough for catch all segments. This tool helps in that case.

## Installation

```bash
bun add -D @vahor/next-broken-links
```

## Usage

After a nextjs build, run the following command:

```bash
next-broken-links
```

It will output the following:

TODO
```

If you have broken links, it will output the following:

```
